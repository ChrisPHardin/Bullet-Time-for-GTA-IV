# Bullet Time for GTA:IV
 Simple Bullet Time script for GTA IV.
 
This is a basic bullet time script that enables bullet time when holding right mouse. Speed can be controlled or the mod can be disabled by pressing page up. Script Hook for GTA:IV required, linked below. This is a very simple script and I'm sure it can be improved upon.

## REQUIREMENTS:
GTAIV .Net Script Hook: https://hazardx.com/files/gta4_net_scripthook-83

## HOW TO INSTALL:
Extract the scripts folder in the archive to your GTAIV directory. In game, aim using right mouse to activate bullet time. Press page up to change settings.

## CREDITS:
I used the Slow Motion script by The SkyReaper AKA LunaXTec as a base for this. Slow motion script here: https://www.nexusmods.com/gta4/mods/1

## CONTROLLER USERS:
Unfortunately, I'm not sure how to use controller input in the script or if it's even possible. However, you can use a program like JoyToKey to assign the controller aiming button to R-Click. I've confirmed this works on my end with a PS4 controller and aiming using the left trigger.
